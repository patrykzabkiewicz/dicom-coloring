# CT colour maps
Natural color map designs for CT images

Basic Concepts
==============

This program implements the basic concept of colour mapping
of CT images. Every given HU value of DICOMM CT scan can
be mapped into colour. This program is intended to provide
easy to use, user freindly GUI interface.

I am providing paid support for this project.
